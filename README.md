# tictactoe

Hello this is the tic tac toe project. This project consist of javascript, html, and css. Doing this project has taught me how to structure my code with the module pattern, where a function can return multiple objects. It taught me how to consider what variables to make private and to use less global variables as it can cause problems such as security issues.
